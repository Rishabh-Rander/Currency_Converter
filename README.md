# API Integration

The project uses the Fetch API to retrieve exchange rates from a currency exchange rate provider. No API key is required for accessing the exchange rates. The latest exchange rates are fetched directly from the provider's API endpoint.
The project uses the Flags API from flagsapi.com to generate flag images for different countries. This API provides high-quality flag images that are displayed alongside currency conversion results to enhance the user experience.
For more information on using the API, you can refer to the official GitHub repository of the currency exchange rate provider at [Currency Provider's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api?tab=readme-ov-file).

# Learning Experience

During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in working with APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript operations, and dynamically updating the DOM based on user input. I also improved my skills in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
